# Cracked On Paper

Getting actionable, crowd-sourced feedback on resumes is hard. Discord servers and forums exist, but they lack a structured or engaging way to see how your resume actually stacks up against others.

CrackedOnPaper turns resume reviews into a head-to-head competition. Your resume is matched against another candidate’s in a “battle,” where users vote on which is more impressive (“cracked”).

Resumes are anonymized and paired by industry and years of experience (YOE), ensuring fair matchups. After uploading, you’ll unlock access to:

- Candid, community feedback on your resume.
- Head-to-head comparisons that show how you perform against real candidates.
- Statistics and leaderboards so you can track your progress and see where you stand.
